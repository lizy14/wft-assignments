## requirements met
This submission tries to satisfy all of the requirements, including the "advanced requirements" of responsive design to support mobile devices and an automated workflow for minifying.

### responsive design
`viewport` metadata and `@media` rules are present. On desktop, text of personal introduction appears on the right of the avatar, while on smaller screens, the avatar appears in the middle and the text appears under it.

Tested on iPhones and iPads emulated by Chrome F12.

### blog post
The blog post, linked to from this homepage, is published on an external personal blog website. The blog website is based on WordPress and hosted by Sina App Engine. It is NOT part of this submission, though the blog post itself is.

### styling
With all due respect, I don't think "大多数人的审美" is something that actually exists. I can't even find an English equivalent of this term. I suggest using "符合助教的审美" instead.

For consistency with my blog post (which is another requirement), styling of this homepage is an imitation of [Twenty Eleven](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyeleven/) by _WordPress Team_. Though they look similar, it's worth emphasizing that no code has been borrowed. Every single line of code in this homepage is handwritten, byte by byte.


### minifying
A `Gruntfile` to minify `.html` `.js` `.css` files is available. Execute `$ grunt` and you'll get all you need to publish at `build/`.

### publication
This website (or webpage, if you insist) is published at http://static.nullspace.cn/wft-assignments/homepage/, hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Source code available at https://github.com/lizy14/wft-assignments/tree/master/homepage.

### browser compatibility
Tested on IE 11, Edge 25, Chrome 51, Firefox 45, Safari 9.
